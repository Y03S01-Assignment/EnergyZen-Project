SDG – AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY 

 
Problem – It is still expensive to use renewable energy technology, which makes it challenging for many people and nations to do so. Inequalities between those who can afford renewable energy and those who cannot result from this. Many nations lack the essential grid networks and storage facilities, as well as other clean energy-supporting infrastructure. Because of this, implementing renewable energy solutions can be challenging, especially in rural or distant places. Solar and wind power are two examples of renewable energy sources that depend on the weather and might be unreliable in some areas. Due to this, it is challenging to meet all your energy needs with only these sources. It's possible that many individuals are unaware of the advantages of clean energy or are unsure of how to use it efficiently. 
 

Solution-   

1.	Promoting the use of clean, inexpensive energy and maintaining its sustainability requires extensive education of the public. We can give you information on the advantages of cheap, clean energy as well as its operation. Information about using energy-efficient appliances, energy-saving techniques, and renewable energy sources like solar and wind power might all be included. To promote accessible, clean energy and to display the newest clean energy technology, we may plan community events like energy fairs and clean energy expose. 

 
2.	Encouraging the use of sustainable energy and lowering carbon emissions by educating people about solar panels and LED lighting is a crucial first step. We can demonstrate the advantages of solar power and LED lighting, including lower energy costs, lower carbon emissions, and greater energy independence. If people are aware of the advantages these technologies may offer, they are more inclined to adopt them. Provide financing alternatives to make it simpler for customers to buy and install LED lights and solar panels. This may consist of low-interest loans, leasing choices, or other financing plans that lower the cost of these technologies for individuals and companies. 

 
3.	Putting up biogas pits can be a good approach to encourage the use of renewable energy sources and cut waste. We can provide technical support to those who are designing and constructing biogas pits. This could entail offering advice on choosing a site, choosing materials, and using certain construction methods. We can also help people buy supplies and pay for the installation of biogas pits by providing cash or access to funds. This might include financial aid, low-interest loans, or other financing schemes that lower the cost of these technologies for individuals and companies. 

 

4.      People have a significant impact on the development of innovative technologies that promote renewable energy. People may support innovation in the renewable energy sector and advance the shift to a clean energy future by giving feedback, taking part in focus groups, sharing their ideas with industry organizations, cooperating with universities and research institutes, and entering innovation competitions.
